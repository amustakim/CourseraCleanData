**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones: _Tidy Dataset_**

> This code book describes the `data and variables` from 
the original [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and any `transformations` performed to clean up that data resulting in a `tidy data set`.

##Data and Variables 
As described in the experiment, 30 volunteers within 19 to 48 years old of age, each wore a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist and performed six discreet activities (`walking`, `walking upstairs`, `walking downstairs`, `sitting`, `standing` and `laying`) as built-in sensors in their smart phones collected data on their activities.  The data is simply a collection of raw signals generated by the accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded within the smartphones.

###Raw Signal Data Points
There are 17 raw signals data points and they can be categorized as:    

>**t** denotes time, **f** denotes frequency domain signals (Hz) and **XYZ** denotes X, Y and Z coordinates

**Main Signals**
 	
	1. tGyro-XYZ (3-Axial Angular Velocity from gyroscope)  
	2. tAcc-XYZ (3-Axial Linear Acceleration accelerometer)

**Components Linear Acceleration**

	3. tGravityAcc-XYZ (Gravitation Acceleration)
	4. tBodyAcc-XYZ (Body Acceleration)

**Jerk Signals**

	5. tBodyAccJerk-XYZ (Body Acceleration Jerk)
	6. tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ (Angular Velocity Jerk)

**Magnitude (Euclidean norm)**

	7. tBodyAccMag (Body Acceleration Magnitude)
	8. tGravityAccMag (Gravity Acceleration Magnitude)
	9. tBodyAccJerkMag (Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude)
	10. tBodyGyroMag (Body Angular Velocity Magnitude)
	11. tBodyGyroJerkMag  (Body Angular Velocity Jerk Magnitude) 

**FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**

	12. fBodyAcc-XYZ (Body Acceleration)
	13. fBodyAccJerk-XYZ (Body Acceleration Jerk)
	14. fBodyGyro-XYZ (Body Angular Velocity)
	15. fBodyAccJerkMag (Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude)
	16. fBodyGyroMag (Body Angular Velocity Magnitude)
	17. fBodyGyroJerkMag (Body Angular Velocity Jerk Magnitude)



###Variable Names
The 17 main variables that were calculated from these signals are:

1. **mean()**: Mean value
2. **std()**: Standard deviation
3. **mad()**: Median absolute deviation 
4. **max()**: Largest value in array
5. **min()**: Smallest value in array
6. **sma()**: Signal magnitude area
7. **energy()**: Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
8. **iqr()**: Interquartile range 
9. **entropy()**: Signal entropy
10. **arCoeff()**: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
11. **correlation()**: correlation coefficient between two signals
12. **maxInds()**: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
13. **meanFreq()**: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
14. **skewness()**: skewness of the frequency domain signal 
15. **kurtosis()**: kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
16. **bandsEnergy()**: Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT (Fast Frontier Transform) of each window.
17. **angle()**: Angle between two vectors. On this variable, additional vectors were obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample:

	1. gravityMean (Mean of Gravity)
	2. tBodyAccMean (Mean of Body Acceleration)
	3. tBodyAccJerkMean (Mean of Body Acceleration Jerk)
	4. tBodyGyroMean (Mean of Body Angular Velocity)
	5. tBodyGyroJerkMean (Mean of Body Angular Velocity Jerk)
